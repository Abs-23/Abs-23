## 🔎 About Me

Data Engineer with a Master’s in Data Science who enjoys turning messy, real‑world data into reliable, analytics‑ready and ML‑ready pipelines. I have professional experience as a Data Engineer at Accenture and hands‑on project work in finance and healthcare using tools like dbt, DuckDB, Databricks, PySpark, SQL, Python, and Power BI.

I care about clear data models, built‑in quality checks, and making it easy for analysts, data scientists, and AI systems to trust the data they consume.

I focus on:
- Building end‑to‑end ELT pipelines that turn raw data into trusted tables for analytics and ML.
- Designing data models and Power BI dashboards that answer real business questions.
- Strengthening data quality with validation checks, anomaly detection, and clear data contracts..
- Supporting ML and AI use cases with clean feature tables, MLflow, and explainable models.
- Exploring AI agents and modern AI workflows after completing Google’s 5‑Day Agentic AI course.

Open to roles across domains (finance, healthcare, public sector, and beyond).
